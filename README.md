# Token Engineering Practice 02

This repository documents a second hands-on token engineering practice,
focused on emission schedules, incentive alignment, and sustainability.

The goal is to deepen understanding of how emissions shape behavior
over time in Web3 protocols.

---

## Focus Areas

- Emission schedule design
- Validator vs user incentives
- Declining inflation mechanics
- Long-term sustainability

---

## Core Principle

Incentives drive behavior.
If emissions reward the wrong actions, the protocol degrades over time.
This practice is part of an ongoing effort to develop practical
token engineering skills through hands-on modeling.
