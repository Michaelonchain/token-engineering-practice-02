# Emission Schedule Design

## Total Supply
1,000,000,000 tokens

---

## Annual Inflation Model

The protocol uses a declining inflation schedule:

- Year 1: 5%
- Year 2: 4%
- Year 3: 3%
- Year 4: 2%
- Year 5: 1%

This approach supports early growth while reducing long-term dilution.

## Rationale

Early participants take higher risk and require stronger incentives.
As the protocol matures, emissions decrease to protect long-term holders.
