# Incentive Alignment

## Emission Allocation

Annual emissions are distributed as follows:

- Validators: 70%
- Active users: 30%

Validators receive a higher share due to their role in securing the network.

---

## Locking Mechanism

To discourage short-term farming:

- Rewards require locking (30–90 days)
- Longer lockups earn higher rewards
- Early unlocks incur penalties

---

## Behavioral Impact

This design:
- Reduces sell pressure
- Rewards long-term participation
- Aligns individual incentives with protocol health
